# Elixir Phoenix RethinkDB Example App

This is a very basic example of how to add RethinkDB to Phoenix. Be sure to
checkout the commits for the exact steps to take.


## To start your Phoenix app:
  1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  2. Start RethinkDB in another terminal
  3. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`
  4. Visit [`localhost:4000/init-table`](http://localhost:4000/init-table) to create a posts example table

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
The response will return a JSON response with two example posts.
